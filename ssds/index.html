		    was added to SDS in November 2008. Also marked the "do not return entitiy bodies on PUT/POST" item as closed out. SDS
		    never returned these bodies and that item should not have appeared on the list.

		<h4>2008-11-30</h4>
		<p>
            This <a href="../examples/ssds/wishlist/index.html">SDS Feature Wish List</a> page contains features and other 'wish list' items I've collected while working with Microsoft's
            <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/data.mspx" title="SQL Data Services.">SDS</a>. You might notice that most of the requests
            I list here relate to 'application protocol' level items - HTTP. That's because I cam currently most
            interested in these issues and I have not found too many others covering the same space.
            I know there are lots of important database-related features that SDS can include, too. I leave
            the work of documenting those feature requests to others.

		<h2>SDS Photo Demo Web App</h2>
		<h4>2008-11-15</h4>
		<p>
            <a href="http://amundsen.com/examples/sds-photos/" title="SDS Photo Demo">This demo</a> stores @200 original images (plus another 400 thumbnail and preview versions) along with JS and CSS files directly 
            in SDS storage (about 80MB in all). A small C# ASP.NET handler accepts anonymous requests, processes them and, when needed 
            initiates authenticated requests to an SDS-Proxy that then talks directly to SDS servers to get the images, scripts, and stylesheets. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The home page is HTML generated using XSLT against the Entity list returned from SDS. The only files on the web server are the
            C# DLL, a single XSLT file, and the web.config file. No HTML, no CSS, no JS, no images. All those are stored in SDS.
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: For this demo, minimal caching is used on the client in order to show the speed of SDS even when using intermediaries such as 
            the SDS-Proxy. Images (some over 1MB) are currently cached for ten minutes to show relative speed during a single session. 
            In a production application, additional caching would be used to reduce avg. page load to less than 1 sec.

		<h2>Updated SDS Provisioning Client Supports JOIN, ORDERBY, and TAKE</h2>
		<h4>2008-11-05</h4>
		<p>
		    This update of the existing Provisioning Client now points to the 'new' SDS data cluster that supports JOIN, ORDERBY, and TAKE queries.
		</p>
		<p>
		    During the last week of October 2008, the SDS team released an update for SSDS (now called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/azure/data.mspx" title="SQL Data Services">SDS</a>.
		    This update supports new query features such as JOIN, ORDERBY, and TAKE (top). Whe the SDS team released the new update,
		    they posted it to a new set of servers. For that reason, data accessed with this client will not be the same physical data
		    as that accessed with the previious release.
		</p>
		<p>
		    There's nothing fancy or new in this release, except for point it to the new servers. All the query magic happens on the SDS servers
		    themselves. There are some additional documentation items that I'll add over the coming days to bring the query hints into line
		    with the new features. I also still have binary upload support to add to this client sometime soon. If you have a feature in mind,
		    let me know (see the comment links on this page) and I'll consider it for the next update.

		<h2>Updated SDS PROXY Supports JOIN, ORDERBY, and TAKE</h2>
		<h4>2008-11-01</h4>
		<p>
		    This update of the existing SSDS-Proxy server now points to the 'new' SDS data cluster that supports JOIN, ORDERBY, and TAKE queries.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The SDS-Proxy is meant to be a 'front' to the actual SDS data servers. I use it in my programs instead of the actual SDS data servers.
		    SDS-Proxy offers some additional caching as well as a 'normalized' URI pattern most HTTP/REST folks will recognize: 
		    <code>http://amundsen.com/sds-proxy/[authority]/[container]/[entity]</code>. SDS-Proxy supports GET, HEAD, POST(create), PUT(update), and DELETE methods.
		    SDS-Proxy recognizes the standard SDS MIME-Type: <code>application/x-ssds+xml</code> as well as any MIME-type used when you stored your 'binary'
		    objects to SDS (<code>image/*, text/plain, etc.</code>).
		</p>
		<p>
		    SDS-Proxy can be reached using your existing SDS credentials
		    (via HTTP Basic Auth) at the following URL: <a href="http://amundsen.com/sds-proxy/" title="http://amundsen.com/sds-proxy/">http://amundsen.com/sds-proxy/</a>.
		    You'll need an HTTP client kit (or utility) that allows you to manipulate HTTP headers, URI, and bodies. I use the very helpful
		    <a href="index.html" title="WFETCH">WFETCH.EXE</a>, but other tools such as <b>wget</b> or <b>cUrl</b> will work fine, too.
		</p>
		<p>

		<h2>Entity-Binding Strongly-typed DataSets for SSDS</h2>
		<h4>2008-10-13</h4>
		<p>
		    This update contains a new demo app: <b>Entity-Binding</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The <b>Entity-Binding</b> demo shows how to generate and use standard strongly-typed DataSets to access SSDS data. I 
		    built this app to show the DataSets get along just fine w/ SSDS. I created an XSD document to match my 
		    <a href="http://amundsen.com/sds/tasks/" title="Task List">Task List</a> entity. I then used <code>XSD.exe</code>
		    to generate a CS class that defines a strongly-typed DataSet to match the Task entity. Finally, I created a small
		    console app that gets the live Task list, loads it into the DataSet and enumerates the DataSet to the console.
		</p>
		<p>
		    This is a really simple demo. Other things are possible including adding support for Views (sorting, filters); 
		    supporting DataSet changes (add, update, delete); and full-fledged data-binding for WinForms controls like DataGrid, etc.
		    It would also b e possible to add more automation the process of generating the classes from live SSDS data. If there is
		    more interest in this project, I'd consider spending more time. Let me know!

		<h2>General Update Posted</h2>
		<h4>2008-09-08</h4>
		<p>
		    This update contains changes to three samples: The <b>SSDS-Proxy</b>, <b>SSDS Provision Client</b>, and <b>SSDS Deploy</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <b>SSDS-Proxy (1.5)</b> now returns authority lists for the logged in user and has basic support for BLOB files. This also required
		    updates to the internal <code>HttpClient</code> class and the <code>Caching</code> class to support <code>BinaryWrite</code>.
		    More work is needed soon (for example, this version does not support <em>uploading</em> BLOB files), but this is a bit step
		    forward for making both the Proxy and the underlying <code>HttpClient</code> much more versatile.
		</p>
		<p>
		    <b>SSDS Provision Client (1.7)</b> now supports reading and deleting BLOB files (no upload yet). It also returns the list of 
		    authorities for the logged-in user. This means it's now possible to update the general login UI to let users login right away
		    and get direct feedback if the login fails. 
		</p>
		<p>
		    <b>SSDSDeploy.exe (1.1)</b> has a bug fix for large files. Actually, the existing code had a nasty bug in the routine that
		    declared the async callback method for the upload. This prevented files larger than twice the buffer size from uploading properly.
		    I also added feedback during the upload process in the for of 'progress dots.' Until I update the SSDS-Procy and Provision Client
		    to support BLOB uploads, this is the easiest way to upload BLOB files to your SSDS account.

		<h2>Version 1.0 of SSDSDeploy Demo Posted</h2>
		<h4>2008-08-18</h4>
		<p>
		    This application allows users to upload one or more files (using wildcards) from their workstation
		    to the SSDS servers (see syntax examples below).  Currently SSDS does not properly handle entityIds 
		    with "/" or "\" in their name. For that reason, a valid upload entity name is "filename.ext", but 
		    *not* "/images/filename.ext" I have a possible work-around using some other URL-safe character as
		    the 'folder seperator' (":"?), but I'm not sure how soon I'll update the codebase to support this.
		</p>
		<p>
		    One of the interesting bits of code in this demo is the <code>GetMimeType(string filename)</code> method.
		    This uses the extension of the disk file to lookup the MIME type in the Windows Registry. 
		</p>
		<p>Here's the sample syntax for <code></code>SSDSDeploy.exe</code></p>
		<pre>
SSDS Deploy Console (1.0 - 2008-08-18)

POST single binary file:
/{a}/{c}/{e} "[c:][\folder\path\]file.ext" ["mime-type"] [y]
where:
	{a} = authority
	{c} = container
	{e} = entity
	 y  = overwrite existing entities

ex:	/my-auth/files/my-profile "c:\temp\profile.jpg" "image\jpeg" y

POST multiple files using wildcard:
/{a}/{c}/* "[c:][\folder\path\]*.*" [y]

ex:	/my-authority/my-container/* "c:\uploads\*.*" y
	or
ex:	/my-authority/my-container/* "c:\images\*.png" y</pre>

		<h2>Version 1.3 of Guestbook Client Demo Posted</h2>
		<h4>2008-08-08</h4>
		<p>
		    This update contains support for replies to posts and publishes RSS feeds for the public list
		    and for each guest account. Several other small twekas have been done to improve the UI a bit, too.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Please visit the app, craete an account and post some messages. The more guests that sign up, the more

		<h2>Version 1.0 of Guestbook Client Demo Posted</h2>
		<h4>2008-07-31</h4>
		<p>
		    This application is a simple 'guestbook' web app that allows users to leave messages for everyone to see.
		    As an added feature, users must create an account in order to post messages. This allowed me to test out
		    a cookie-based authentication pattern that mimics the <code>HTTP Basic Auth</code> pattern. That means that
		    you can authenticate against this application using a browser-based cookie or by passing the same credentials
		    via the HTTP Basic spec.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Another focus of this demo was using a single SSDS Container (<code>guestbook</code>that holds multiple 
		    'kinds' of Entity documents (<code>guest</code> and <code>message</code>). This means queries against the 
		    datastore need to make sure they get the correct entity type back. I am also interested in how performance
		    will be affected using these more complicated queries to filter messages by guest, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		    In addition, since the application could be updated quite frequently I did some work to make sure entity lists
		    are cached by the local server using <code>ETags</code>. ETags are currently supported by SSDS, but only 
		    for single Entity objects, not for lists. Of course, it's not much of a challenge to *cache* the lists,
		    it's the <em>invalidation of the cached lists</em> that offers the greatest challenge [grin].

		<h2>New SSDS.EXE Console App Posted</h2>
		<h4>2008-07-18</h4>
		<p>
		    This is a simple console app that you can use the interact with your SSDS data directly from the command line. This

		<h2>Version 1.4 of Data Client Demo Released w/ refactored Javascript code</h2>
		<h4>2008-07-14</h4>
		<p>
		    This release has only a few new bits of functionality: added "Refresh" buttons for Containers
		    and Entities lists; links to the Feedback page; better error messages. The real work in this
		    update was behind the scenes. The Javascript class (provision.js) has been completely rewritten.
		    It should now be easier to maintain and easier to read, too.

		    For those who are watching this project, I plan on another update soon that will change the URI pattern
		    for the calls to the SSDS proxy server. In fact, I suspect I'll publish a clean SSDS Proxy API (REST)
		    in the next week or so. That will allow others to start writing their clients against the same
		    proxy, if they like.

		<h2>Version 1.3 of Data Client Demo Released - now with Caching!</h2>
		<h4>2008-07-10</h4>
		<p>
		    In anticipation of caching support in the upcoming SSDS 'Sprint 3' release, I added caching to my SSDS
		    Proxy (the server code behind the SSDS Client demo app). Now, GETS are cached at the server to reduce
		    traffic between the SSDS Proxy and the remote SSDS server. This also cuts down on trasffic between the
		    client apps and the SSDS Proxy. Currently, there'a bit more traffic betweeen SSDS Proxy and the SSDS 
		    servers since SSDS server do not yet support caching. Once they add support for ETag and If-Match headers,
		    traffic between the proxy and SSDS will decrease even more.
		</p>
		<p>
		    A nice side-effect of implementing caching support (via ETags) is that the proxy can now implement a fix
		    for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/" title="Detecting the Lost Update Problem Using Unreserved Checkout">Lost Update Problem</a>.
		    Now, when multiple users are editing the same document, no-one's edits will get 'clobbered' by another user's
		    updates. That's because the <code>ETag</code> header value returned via <code>HTTP GET</code> needs to be sent with the updated document
		    as the <code>If-Match</code> header value when making an <code>HTTP PUT</code> to the server. If the headers
		    do not match, the server assumes someone else has updated the document and refuses to complete the <code>PUT</code>.
		    It takes a bit of planning to implement on the client but once you have it, your users will be much happier!

		<h2>Data Client Demo Updated</h2>
		<h4>2008-07-08</h4>
		<p>
		    I updated the Provisioning Demo. The <a href="../examples/sds/data-client/index.html" title="SSDS Provisioning Client">SSDS Provisioning Client</a>
		    now supports a simple Entity query interface. Once you select your Authority and Container, you can enter any valid SSDS query and see
		    the resulting filtered list. I also did a little UI clean-up including an alert to remind you to login before you begin executing commands.

		<h2>Data Client Demo</h2>
		<h4>2008-07-04</h4>
		<p class="notice">
		   I updated the SSDS Data Client code today and IE should now work as expected. If you see any problems,
		   feel free to send an email to:<span class="email">mamund#AT#yahoo#DOT#com</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
		    I posted a new demo application here today. The <a href="../examples/sds/data-client/index.html" title="SSDS Provisioning Client">SSDS Provisioning Client</a>
		    allows you to manage all your SSDS Authorities, Containers, and Entities via a simple (quirky?) Web UI.  This was build to explore the details
		    of managing SSDS objects via the REST interface. All requests from the Ajax client go directly to an SSDS Proxy server
		    which interprets the data and then makes calls to the remote SSDS servers on your behalf.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		    This web application requires you to login with your SSDS username and password. Since this is a public web app
		    hosted via HTTP (not HTTPS), you may not want to use the live version of the app. Instead, download the source
		    code and host the application on your own local server.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
		    One of the interesting features of this application is that it contains code for generating unqiue (Ascending or Descending) IDs for
		    Entity objects. Some of this was discussed on a recent <a href="http://forums.msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/ssdsgetstarted/thread/591b888b-fcf0-4026-a521-c2a8ef5a51a0" title="How are you populating your Entity ID fields?">SSDS Forum thread</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The current code is fairly solid, but will probably be updated as the SSDS beta progresses. I'll keep tweaking it and posting
		    results to the <a href="http://mikeamundsen.googlecode.com/" title="Mike Amundsen's Googlecode sapce">SVN code space</a>. Feel free to send me feedback via email: <span class="email">mamund#AT#yahoo#DOT#com.</span>

		<h2>TaskList Demo</h2>
		<h4>2008-06-23</h4>
		<p>
		    I posted the Tasklist Demo today. You can check out a simple HTML <a href="../examples/sds/task-web-client/index.html" title="SSDS Tasklist Demo">web client</a>
		    to see how it all works. You can also ping the rasw XML data in the SSDS repository via the <a href="http://amundsen.com/ssds-tasks/" title="SSDS Proxy">SSDS Proxy</a> server (built using C#).
		    Finally, you can check out the source code for both projects at my <a href="http://mikeamundsen.googlecode.com" title="Mike Amundsen @ googlecode">google code</a>
		    site.
		</p>
		<p>
		    The current code is pretty 'rangy.' Not quite ready for a live demo. But it all works. I'll keep tweaking it and posting
		    results to the SVN space. Feel free to send me feedback via email: <span class="email">mamund#AT#yahoo#DOT#com.</span>
