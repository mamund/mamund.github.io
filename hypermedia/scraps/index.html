          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p>
						When setting out to design a hypermedia type to solve a problem the designer needs
						to go through four primary decisions. These decisions set the tone for the 
						hypermedia features available to clients and servers using the hypermedia type.
					</p>
              <dl>
                <dt>Base Format</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
								What is the base format (base media type) of your hypermedia type. Most designers start with
								XML or JSON; usually not a good idea. It would be better to start w/ (X)HTML
								since that media type has hypermedia controls 
								<a href="../html/index.html">built in</a>. XML and JSON have no
								built-in hypermedia controls and designers will need to create their own AND make sure
								all servers and clients understand these added features of the media type.
							</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>Application Domain</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
								How will application-specific information be conveyed within the hypermedia type? How
								will clients and servers recognize domain objects ("customer-name"), links ("add-customers"),
								and other important details? Existing media types handle this differently.
							</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
									NONE: HTML has no domain specificity built-in. None of the element names or attributes carry
									built-in application domain meaning (except possibly for "documents").
								</li>
                    <li>
									GENERAL: Atom has "general" domain specificty built-in. There are clear elements w/ meaningful names
									and selected elements have well-defined hypermedia meaning (rel="sef" and rel="edit", etc.). This
									general specificity works well for "generic" solutions. But sometimes Atom's limited domain semantics
									makes customizing the responses difficult.
								</li>
                    <li>
									SPECIFIC: VoiceXML has rather specific application-level elements. It is relatively easy to read
									a VoiceXML document and understand what the application does just from the element/attribute choices. Your
									solution may call for a very specific set of attributes and elements in order to express your
									app domain directly within the document.
								</li>
                  </ol>
                </dd>
                <dt>State Transfer</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
								How will clients send data back to servers? How will that transfer their own "state" values to the server
								for processing? Again, there are three basic ways to solve this problem:
							</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
									NONE: SVG is a media type that supports no state transfer from client to server. It is a "read-only" 
									hypermedia type.
								</li>
                    <li>
									PRE-DEFINED: Atom uses a "pre-defined" model for clients to transfer state to servers. The Atom documentation
									describes the format and elements that can be sent to the server. It is up to the client to "understand"
									these rules and have them "coded-in."
								</li>
                    <li>
									AD-HOC: HTML uses an "ad-hoc" model for establishing client-to-server state transfers. The HTML documentation
									defines a generic mechanism for sending arbitrary data to servers using the FORM, INPUT, and other related-elements.
									Clients must "understand" the rules for handling FORMs and the related controls as they appear within the 
									response representations.
								</li>
                  </ol>
                </dd>
                <dt>Process Flow</dt>
                <dd>
                  <p>
								How do servers communicate valid process flow to clients? How do clients know what is possible as a "next step"? 
								Once more, I'll suggest three possibilites:
							</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>NONE: HTML has no built-in process flow. It supports transfer protocol actions (GET and POST) and nothing else.</li>
                    <li>
									EMBEDDED: Atom uses an "embedded" model for process flow. The Atom Publishing spec details basic CRUD operations
									that are to be applied to existing elements in response representations (rel="self", rel="edit", etc.).
								</li>
                    <li>
									APPLIED: It is possible to define a set of process-flow definitions and "apply" them to an existing media type.
									For example, the <a href="../profiles/index.html">ALPS</a> model defines all the process-flow
									information for the XHTML media type using @rel and FORM descriptions that properly-coded clients can "recognize" in response representations.
								</li>
                  </ol>
                </dd>
              </dl>
              <p>
						Not every hypermedia solution needs every possible hypermedia option. These four basic decisions also influence each other.
						Selecting JSON as your base type means you start out with no state transfer, but likely have very domain-specific element and attribute 
						design. Selecting XHTML means you get ad-hoc state transfer, but no domain specificity to start. Starting with XML gives you
						the power to design a very specific domain, transfer model, and process flow but you will have a very limited reach in terms
						of existing clients and servers that understand your hypermedia type.

    			  can be located on a continuum to identify their support for hypermedia behaviors. Unlike 
    			  <a href="http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactors/" title="H-Factors">H-Factors</a> which identify
    			  a set of elements that can appear within a media type, "H-Levels" focus on support for a set of 
    			  desired interaction properties between client and server; properties that allow servers and clients 
    			  to evolve independently without "breaking" or becoming unusable together. In reality, support for
    			  these properties means that servers can change responses to client requests in ways that allow
    			  for future modifiability without requiring clients to be updated, re-compiled, or re-deployed.
    			</p>
              <p>
    			  H-Levels are expressed from the viewpoint of the client application. IOW, "What happens to existing
    			  client applications when one or more of these H-Level items is changed?"
    			  The properties of a media-type that can foster support for this type of evolvability in client-to-server
    			  interactions are:

                <dt><span class="hl-item">R/W Semantics</span></dt>
                <dd>
  			      The ability to indicate the available read/write semantics including which elements are 
  			      write-able, the protocol details to be used when requesting, filtering, and writing
  			      data, etc.
  			    </dd>
                <dt><span class="hl-item">Appflow</span></dt>
                <dd>
  			      The ability to modify the application flow (e.g. state-transition steps) 
  			      using in-message control information including adding or removing
  			      state transition steps as needed based on the context of the current
  			      response.
  			    </dd>
              </dl>
              <blockquote>
  			    It should be noted that not all the listed desireable evolvable properties

  			    <span class="hl-item">R/W Semantics</span>, <span class="hl-item">Appflow</span>)
  			    are requried to build successful client-server interactions. Also, the resulting 
  			    ranking is not designed to indicate quality (the higher ranking, the better), but 
  			    simply help identify target media types along a concrete continuum.

    			  Along with the shared data format for requests and responses, servers include URIs within the message

    			  way, servers can safely change the URIs without requiring re-coding the client applications. In this

          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p style="border:2px red solid;"><b>WARNING</b>: There be dragons ahead. Don't go here unless you are sure 
            you'd rather 'roll your own' [hyper]media type instead of using an existing,
            <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/">properly registered</a> one such as 
            <a href="../html/index.html">[X]HTML</a> or 
            <a href="../atom/index.html">Atom</a>.
          </p>
              <p>
            Creating a custom media-type for internal use does not need to be very complicated. If you 
            are working on a localized application and want to get everyone using the same
            state-transfer contract, you can use a simple media type that has just a few 'hooks' and allows
            for future expansion as your needs grow.
          </p>
              <h4>Object Container</h4>
              <p>
            An easy start is to adopt a simple data format that takes on properties of both 
            <a href="../html/index.html">[X]HTML</a> and 
            <a href="../atom/index.html">Atom</a>.
            The &lt;body /&gt; portion can hold a serialization of a custom object (ala Atom-style) at the beginning.
            This makes it easy for developers to use existing frameworks when crafting messages. Here's a
            an example 'skeleton':
          </p>
              <pre>
&lt;root&gt;
  &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;!-- meta-data, system info, etc. can go here --&gt;
  &lt;/meta&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;{custom-object-goes-here} /&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;error&gt;
    &lt;!-- place any error details (text, stack trace, etc.) here --&gt;
  &lt;/error&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
          </pre>
              <h4>Standard Data Representation</h4>
              <p>
            The next step is to standardize the representation of data in the &lt;body /&gt; section of the message.
            IOW, eliminate the use of the object serialization pattern and use an agreed data format that is not 
            bound to server-side storage|object-types. One simple format is to adopt a generic flat name-value pair 
            (NVP) pattern:
          </p>
              <pre>
&lt;root&gt;
  &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;!-- meta-data, system info, etc. can go here --&gt;
  &lt;/meta&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;data name="email"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;data name="username"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;data name="date-created"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;error&gt;
    &lt;!-- place any error details (text, stack trace, etc.) here --&gt;
  &lt;/error&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
          </pre>
              <p>
            Using a dedicated data format like this will add some work for developers; they will need to drop the habit
            of blindly serializing internal objects as public messages. However, once a simple conversion utility is built, it
            is relatively easy to read/write a data format like this. Even better, if you need to add new elements, they can
            appear as one more in the collection. This makes evolving the messages trivial.
          </p>
              <h4>Hypermedia Controls</h4>
              <p>
            In the previous examples, all hypermedia information must be encoded in the client and server themselves.
            For example, knowing what data to write, which URI to use when writing, which HTTP method to use when 
            writing, etc. However, you can greatly increase the value of your data format by adding this semantic information
            into the messages themselves. This takes more planning and requires additional coding (mostly for clients),
            but can pay off in the long run. Here's a simple example:
          </p>
              <pre>
&lt;root&gt;
  &lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;!-- meta data, system info, etc. can go here --&gt;
  &lt;/meta&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- allow searching for one or more users using HTTP GET --&gt;
    &lt;query href="..." rel="search"&gt;
      &lt;data name="username" /&gt;
    &lt;/query&gt;
    &lt;!-- allow sending data to the server, if rel contains "update", use HTTP PUT --&gt;
    &lt;write href="..." rel="user update"&gt;
      &lt;data name="email"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;data name="username"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;data name="date-created"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/write&gt;
    &lt;!-- if rel contains "add" use HTTP POST --&gt;
    &lt;write href="..." rel="user add"&gt;
      &lt;data name="email"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;data name="username"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
      &lt;data name="date-created"&gt;&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;/write&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;error&gt;
    &lt;!-- place any error details (text, stack trace, etc.) here --&gt;
  &lt;/error&gt;
&lt;/root&gt;
          </pre>
              <p>
            Using Hypermedia controls in the message means clients need to be coded to search for and understand
            the various pre-defined controls (in this example they are "query" and "write"). Although this takes
            additional work at first, it means future messages can be crafted w/ new or changed semantics w/o
            requiring a rewrite of the client code.
          </p>
              <h4>Going Beyond Simple</h4>
              <p>
            This is example Hypermedia format, while useful, is very simple. There are lots of features that could
            be added, may be <i>needed</i> to make this a useful media type. The point is that, starting this way
            means you can create a focus on using media-types as a fundamental aspect of your overall architecture.
            By doing so, you get a whole bunch of 'win' without that much initial cost.

          <h3>A media-type does not map to an object</h3>
          <p class="date">2010-07-20</p>
          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p>
            I have seen several examples where folks give media type examples that look like this:
            <code>application/customers+xml</code>, etc. 
            At first, this seems like a good idea, but in the long run, it is not. media-types should
            not be based on "objects" that might exist in the server-side model.
          </p>
              <p>
            Instead, media-types should be designed at the application level; possibly the "task" level.
            IOW, <code>application/accounting+xml</code> or <code>application/shopping+xml</code>, etc.
          </p></entry></div>
          <h3>Hypermedia Design Tips</h3>
          <p class="date">2010-07-08</p>
          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p>
            Here are some tips to keep in mind when designing a hypermedia type.
          </p>
              <dl>
                <dt><b>Don't use actual URIs</b></dt>
                <dd>
              When modeling your hypermedia type, esp. when creating examples, <b>DO NOT</b>
              include actual URIs in the samples. Instead, use a placeholder token (e.g. 
              <code>{uri}</code>).
            </dd>
                <dt><b>Favor Generic Elements</b></dt>
                <dd>
              Generic element names w/ specific attributes are easier to process for most apps and
              they offer more extensibility to application designers. Instead of specific element
              names (<code>&lt;name /&gt;  &lt;email /&gt;</code>, etc.) use a generic element
              along with a name attribute (e.g. <code>&lt;data name="name" /&gt; &lt;data name="email" /&gt;</code>, etc.)
            </dd>
                <dt><b>Plan for Extendability</b></dt>
                <dd>
              Design your media type to allow developers some freedom to extend it in ways
              that you might not think of. For example, don't create such a tight set of
              schema rules that application developers are unable to add new elements or inputs
              as needed.
            </dd>
                <dt><b>Avoid Single-Protocol Designs</b></dt>
                <dd>
              Using a keyword or element (e. g. <code>POST</code>) that is tied too closely 
              to a single protocol (e.g. <code>HTTP</code>) may limit the application of your
              media type in the future. Instead, use generic keywords (<code>WRITE</code>, etc.) 
              or elements that can be "mapped" or "bound" to an application protocol in the 
              implementation phase. 
            </dd>
              </dl></entry></div>
          <h3>Four Aspects of Information Value</h3>
          <p class="date">2010-06-18</p>
          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p>
    				Information should have these four aspects. The more aspects, the higher the
    				value of the information message itself.
    			</p>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Structured</b><br>
    					Messages need structure to provide context. With context, agents
    					(humans, machines, etc.) can derive meaning, establish provenance, 
    					and assess trust. Structure can be expressed as control data 
    					(e.g. HTTP headers) and/or meta-information within the message itself
    					(e.g. markup). 
    				</li>
                <li><b>Linked</b><br>
    					Messages should contian links to other information. Links are another
    					way to add context to the message. Links should be more than arcs from
    					one piece of data to another (e.g. HTNL A tags). Links should also express
    					other relationships such as "fetch and display here" (e.g. HTML IMG tags),
    					"make a request with the following additional inputs" (e.g. HTML FORM w/ GET),
    					and "write the following data to the server" (e.g. HTML FORM w/ POST/PUT/DELETE).
    					Links inform agents of what they can <i>do</i>, not just what they can see.
    				</li>
                <li><b>Portable</b><br>
    					Messages should be portable. They should move freely between locations.
    					Each message should contain all the information needed for agents to use to 
    					render and process as needed. Messages should be able to adapt to the device
    					and context at hand (e.g. content negotiation). Messages should be "re-playable"
    					meaning that they can be stored and accessed at a later date and still successfully
    					render as expected. 
    				</li>
                <li><b>Autonomous</b><br>
    					Messages should be autonomous. They should not be overly dependent on additional
    					messages or their origin server, etc. Messages should not be dependent on separate
    					application programming in order to be useful. IOW, <i>the message is the application</i>.
    					Network-compatible agents should be able to find, consume, and <i>operate on</i> the
    					message - no matter where it comes from. Messages should not be dependent on custom
    					code that must <i>first be installed</i> on the agent.
    				</li>
              </ol></entry></div>
          <h3>Advantages of Hypermedia Types</h3>
          <p class="date">2010-06-08</p>
          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p>
    				Employing hypermedia types on the WWW has a number of advantages:
    			</p>
              <dl>
                <dt>Address Abstraction</dt>
                <dd>
    					Hypermedia types use designated elements (A, FORM, IMG, etc.) and link relations (@rel)
    					as 'tokens' for clients to watch for. The actual contents of the associated URI is not 
    					important to the client. This means the URIs can safely change over time. 
    				</dd>
                <dt>Protocol Abstraction</dt>
                <dd>
    					Hypermedia types can be designed as protocol agnostic. Links can use any protocol supported
    					by the client and can safely change over time as needed.
    				</dd>
                <dt>Object Model Abstraction</dt>
                <dd>
    					Hypermedia types can expose state representation transfers that need not match to any object
    					model or server-side storage model. Passing representations means the server can safely change it's
    					internal object/storage details without breaking the client.
    				</dd>
                <dt>Workflow Abstraction</dt>
                <dd>
    					Hypermedia programming allows sharing representations and links. That means servers can, over time, safely change
    					the flow of an application by introducing links to new state transfers or changing the order of the
    					state transfers.
    				</dd>
                <dt>Function Call Abstraction</dt>
                <dd>
    					Using state transfers means data passed between clients and servers can be in different formats, based
    					on the use case requirements. That includes typical name/value pairs (name=mike&amp;size=large...),
    					binary objects (e.g. image transfers), or even direct transmission of data blocks (e.g. XML, JSON, etc.)
    				</dd>
                <dt>Asynchronous Evolvability</dt>
                <dd>
    					Using Hypermedia types means authors can add new features to the messages without breaking existing clients.
    					The media-type itself can be safely "versioned" in ways that will not break deployed clients, too. This means
    					that new clients can take advantage of the new features while co-existing with the old clients. 
    				</dd>
                <dt>Client-Driven Composability</dt>
                <dd>
    					Clients that understand a wide range of media types can "compose" their own work by leveraging multiple'
    					servers, negotiating media types and, in effect, creating an individualized "program" for the client to 
    					follow. Hypermedia types encourage this "composability" since servers can offer up data via well-designed
    					hypermedia types and allow clients to determine what tasks are done at which locations using the hypermedia
    					control information provided in server responses.
    				</dd>

          <h3>URIs, by themselves, are Just Data</h3>
          <p class="date">2010-06-06</p>
          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><div class="code-block">
                <p>A URI, by itself is a meaningless piece of data:</p>
                <pre>http://www.example.org/q1w2e3r4t5</pre>
              </div>
              <div class="code-block">
                <p>
              You can add hypermedia <i>meaning</i> to the URI by giving it <i>structure</i>.
              Here's one example:
            </p>
                <pre>&lt;img src="http://www.example.org/q12w3e4r4t5" /&gt;</pre>
              </div>
              <div class="code-block">
                <p>Here's another example of structure that provides the same URI with a different meaning:</p>
                <pre>&lt;a href="http://www.example.org/q12w3e4r4t5"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
              </div>
              <div class="code-block">
                <p>Here's an example of the same URI w/ a more complex structure and another meaning:</p>
                <pre>
&lt;form action="http:/www.example.org/q1w2e3r4t5"&gt;
  &lt;input name="search" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>
              </div>
              <p>
            Each [hyper]media-type allows the author to add meaning to URIs in appropriate ways.
            The more rich the expression of URIs, the more powerful the [hyper]media-type.
            [Hyper]media-types that have only a few ways to provide meaning to URIs have limited
            value on the Web. Those that provide no structure (meaning) to URIs are not [hyper]media-types
            at all.

          <h3>Inverse Relationship between Native Functionality vs. Code-On-Demand</h3>
          <p class="date">2010-06-05</p>
          <div class="scrap-entry"><entry><p>
            As a [hyper]media-type's <b>native functionality</b> (it's built-in semantics for
            <i>data</i>, <i>read-write</i>, and <i>presentation</i>) is percieved to fall short of 
            user|developer expectations, 
            <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_on_demand" title="Code on demand">code-on-demand</a></b> 
            (COD) will be employed in greater
            frequency and size . IOW, if the native semantics fall short, devs will use 
            custom coding to compensate.
          </p>
              <p>
            It's important to note that it is the <i>perceived</i> shortcomings of the media-type
            that drive this increased reliance on COD. Poorly-trained|informed
            developers may needlessly drive up the COD value of a response.
