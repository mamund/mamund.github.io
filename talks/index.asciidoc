.About this List...
____
This is an evolving curated list of my public talks starting in 2012. You'll find a mixed bag here of "session" talks and keynotes. Some have extensive supporting materials (transcripts, videos, references, etc.) and some are just pointers to a slide deck. You may also find that some of the links to host events are now broken or pointing to more recent editions of the same event. I won't often do link-fixing here but if _you_ find a bad link _and_ have a fix, feel free to email it to me (see below) 

Feel free to reference any of this material in your own talks. I'd appreciate a mention/reference pointer back to the source here and, whenever possible, ping me to let me know about your referrer.
