over the last several weeks, i've been working on a number of hypermedia designs.
some of these are for clients' production implementations but many of them are
just explorations of the design patterns and constraints; ways to learn how to
effectively and efficiently express a problem domain within a hypermedia type
design.
</p>
<p>
it's been a very interesting experience! 
</p>
<p>what follows are my notes and
observations about an ongoing process of discovery related to designing 
and implementing hypermedia-driven solutions. some of this is direct
recounting of my experience (including interaction w/ devs, etc.). most of it
is idle talk and musing borne of my own personal assumptions about anecdotal
observations and feedback. 
</p>
<h4>conceptual elements</h4>
<p>
as i work through the various designs, i am finding that my personal style
leads to a focus on two key conceptual elements: <i>representations</i> and 
<i>transfers</i>. these names might not be the best as they are rather 
ambigous, but these are the 'labels' that are working in my head right now.
</p>
<h4>representations</h4>
<p>
<i>representations</i> are the responses from servers that express the current 
start of an identified resource. a response might represent the list of 
open orders, a single users' profile, the result of an attempt to update
an existing customer record, etc. 
</p>
<p>
some folks think of a representation as a 'web page' or as an 'object graph' 
from the data store. i think that mental model is too limiting. it leads devs
into designing resouces and crafting URIs to reach them. to me this is going
about it in the wrong way. my approach is to identify the state that needs to
be represented (the user list, the composite of todays news, a complete
invoice, etc.). this representation might span several storage collections/records.
it might not exist as any single stored entity at all. 
</p>
<h4>transfers</h4>
<p>
the act of representing the current state of an identified resource is relatively
straight forward. what does a "user" need to "see" when they make a request?
the more interesting work (to me) is enhancing that state representation with
one or more <i>transfer</i> options. client-initiated state transfers allow
the "user" to *do* something (navigate to a new page, filter the data, search
for other data, etc.).
</p>
<p>
typically, transfers can be simple (they don't need any arguments) or 'complex'
(they include one or more arguments that are passed to the server with the request).
simple transfers can be represented as links in the response:
</p>
<pre class="code">
{"link" : {"href" : "...", "rel" : "users"}}
</pre>
<p>
complex transfers can be represented as a template; one that includes both a URI
and one or more 'input' elements (some of which might be pre-filled and/or read-only).
</p>
<pre class="code">
{"link" : 
   {"href"  : "...", "rel" : "users"},
   data [
     {"name" : "first-name", "value" : ""},
     {"name" : "last-name", "value" : ""),
     {"name" : "status", "value" : "new", "read-only" : true}
   ]
}
</pre>
<p>
my transfers are always marked with an identifier (usually named "rel" to take
advantage of the 'shared understanding' that comes from the HTML.A.@rel pattern).
client applications are "taught" to pay attention to the identifier, not the URI.
my client applications are essentially 'coded for rels.' it's the rel that is
interesting|meaningful to the client apps i write.
</p>
<h4>expressing a problem domain via transfers and representations</h4>
<p>
the process of expressing a <i>problem domain</i> is the process of identifying 
and designing each representation and transfer that is needed. it's not very
complicated work, but it does require attention to detail. the process goes
relatively smoothly when i am using a base format (HTML, JSON, XML) that already
has solid support for <a href="../../hypermedia/hfactor.html">H-Factors</a>, 
too. this is especially true when crafting transfers.
</p>
<p>
as i go through the process of designing representations and transfers, i end
up with a collection of them; each one providing a needed solution for the
problem domain. the aggregate of these representations and transfers make up
the 'complete' expression of the target domain; the implementation at the
message level. essentially, this <i>is</i> the hypermedia application.
</p>
<h4>no flowcharts, no arrows, just states</h4>
<p>
one of the (many) key revelations for me in this process has been the realization
that i do not find flow charts or detailed 'arrows and boxes' very helpful in
either documenting or representing the problem domain. this may just be my own
POV, but i find the collection of representations and transfers appear to me as
a set of independent (stateless) 'bulding blocks' that can be assembled in 
various ways to successfully express just about any scenario of representation
response and transfer request options that might be needed for the problem domain.
</p>
<p>
even more interesting (to me) is the discovery that these transfers and representations
can be cobbled together in ways that i didn't (at first) consider. i find that
some devs, working with the media type design and the list of representations
and transfers, are crafting new 'work flow' and 'processing' chains that were
not initially described in discovery. the media type is 'leading' devs into
discovering new ways to provide the users w/ the representations and transfer
options needed to solve 'new' problems.
</p>
<p>
the design is evolving even at the early stages.
</p>
<h4>what deoes this all mean?</h4>
<p>
so, as i progress through trial and error, i am building up a body of 
knowledge; a set of practices that work in many cases. i am also discovering
that some of my assumptions about how things work, how devs approach solutions
and how users evaulate the results are not always right; i have some bad
assumptions! 
</p>
<p>
right now that body of knowledge is pretty basic:
</p>
<ul>
<li>focus on transfers (requests) and representations (responses)</li>
<li>work through the problem domain to identify all the transfer/representations needed</li>
<li>use a base format that supports the H-Factors needed to handle the transfers</li>
<li>treat transfers and representations as 'stand-alone' building blocks</li>
<li>allow devs to use the blocks to craft responses that meet users' requirements</li>
<li>as time goes on, continue the same process and allow the implementation to evolve</li>
</ul>
<p>
i don't present this as 'fully-baked' concrete practice; just as my own
ideas on what i've learned and how things play out as i go along. hopefully
these notes will be helpful as you make your own journeys through 
'hypermedia-land.'
</p>
