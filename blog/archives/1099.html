  it's been a busy month or so for me. among other things, i was lucky enough
  to participate in <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/" title="GOTO Copenhagen">GOTOCPH 2011</a> 
  a couple weeks ago. while there, in between hanging w/ several

  <a href="http://twitter.com/iansrobinson" title="Ian S Robinson">smart</a>
  <a href="http://twitter.com/algermissen" title="Jan Algermissen">people</a>, 
  i had the opportunity to present my talk
  "<a href="http://www.amundsen.com/talks/#beyond-rest" title="Beyond REST">
    Beyond REST : An approach for crafting stable, evolve-able Web applications
  </a>."
  this talk is the first one i've delivered in quite a while aimed at
  "system-level thinking." the material is a bit "fuzzy" right now but, based on 
  my experience over the last few years, there are some valuable bits here (even
  if i don't have much solid evidence or dispassionate rhetoric, or a 
  <a href="../../images/hypermedia/hfactors-html.png" title="Hypermedia Factors">cool graphical model</a> to back up my talk[grin]).
</p>
<p>
  you can check out the slides, but here is a 
  <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/TLDNR" title="too long; did not read">tl;dnr</a> version:
</p>
<h4>The Question</h4>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    "How can we design and implement distributed network solutions that remain
    stable and flexible over time?"
  </p>
  <p>
    "How can we create 'Evolvable systems?'" 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  frankly, it's not all that hard to put up an 'app' that can be reached 'on the Web.' the hard part
  is implementing a solution that can successfully evolve over time. this is especially challenging
  when done in a distributed network where there is no central control of all the participants; where
  some client apps or server apps are built and maintained by parties that have no direct physical
  or cultural ties (other than the 'app' itself). 
</p>
<p>
  my assertion is that one successful approach invovles a combintion of accepting and embracing some
  realites of dist-net architecture, isolating the key transient aspect of the environment, and 
  focusing most of your creative eneregies on expressing the vital problem domain information in a
  flexible and evolvable way.
</p>
<h4>The Transfer Protocol</h4>
<blockquote>
  "HTTP is standardized, stable, and subject to careful review and control. 
  Accept HTTP 'as-is' and stop trying to turn it into something else in order to solve your
  own private system problems."
</blockquote>
<p>
  today, dist-net apps are almost always built using HTTP as the <i>Transfer Protocol</i>. however, too 
  many implementations treat HTTP as a 'burden' instead of a boon. many programming frameworks
  do thier best to 
  <a href="http://cappuccino.org/learn/tutorials/starter-tutorial.php" title="Cappuccino Starter package">hide HTTP from devs</a>. 
  most devs are actually encouraged to ignore key aspects of the protocol 
  (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html" title="Caching in HTTP">caching</a>, 
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/" title="Detecting the Lost Update Problem Using Unreserved Checkout">concurrency</a>, 
  <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/3583" title="REST, HTTP, Sessions and Cookies">state-lessness</a>, 
  etc.). finally, some environments treat HTTP
  as a 'malleable space' where 
  <a href="http://restlet-discuss.1400322.n2.nabble.com/Adding-custom-HTTP-methods-td6317815.html" title="Adding custom HTTP methods">adding new methods</a>
  and 
  <a href="http://rubyglasses.blogspot.com/2011/03/adding-custom-http-headers-to-soap4r.html" title="Adding custom HTTP headers to soap4r request">meta-data</a> (headers) 
  in order to maintain 'the fiction' of a 
  '<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc337884.aspx" title="Building Web Apps without Web Forms">local application model</a>' 
  is perfectly acceptable instead
  of changing one's design paradigm to better fit 
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm" title="Representational State Transfer (REST)">HTTP's established communications model</a>.
</p>
<p>
  this leads to ineffciencies, frustration, and - in some cases - causes harm to both users and devs.
</p>
<p>
  the better way to deal with HTTP is to <i>embrace</i> it. let HTTP lead system designers in the 
  direction of lossy, chunky, state-less designs. accept HTTP as the stable rarely-changing
  foundation for your implementations. learn to 'think' and 'speak' HTTP so that all your dist-net
  designs reflect the power, stability, and reliability of HTTP itself. and don't fuss with it.
</p>
<h4>State Management</h4>
<blockquote>
  "If HTTP is the standard, stable foundation of the network, 
  <i>State Management</i> is HTTP's transient, unreliable cousin."
</blockquote>
<p>
  time and again, i find devs trying to 
  '<a href="http://support.softartisans.com/kbview_670.aspx" title="Maintaining Session State &amp; Sharing Data Across Servers, Domains &amp; the Entire Internet">swim against the tide</a>' 
  of HTTP and figure out ways to 
  persist state information over an extended set of interactions on the Web. while it usually
  works, it often takes way too much effort (from the dev or the framework) and results in brittle
  implementations that 'leak' personal data and/or screw up important data points somewhere along 
  the way. some implementations go so far as to inject this transient information directly into
  representation responses in an attempt to get both client and server to 'share' 
  <a href="http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC141866.gif" title="ASP.NET View State">huge chunks</a> of
  volatile per-request data that should never be shipped repeatedly back and forth between the 
  server and <i>every single client</i> that server is trying to support.
</p>
<p>
  instead of 
  <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/session/" title="Session State">constantly inventing new ways</a> 
  to ignore that state-less nature of dist-net interactions,
  designers and developers need to stop polluting the public internet with their transient personalization
  data bits. clients should keep track of the information users need (that's why they are often called
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent" title="User agent">user agents</a>). 
  servers should keep track of the information required to support the private components
  running behind public-facing URIs. and implementations should be designed to allow clients and servers
  to drop, and then later pick up, interaction threads at any time w/o complex work needed to 
  're-establish' session scaffolding all over again.
</p>
<p>
  again, state is transient and volatile. let clients and servers deal with this information on their
  own, in their own ways, using their own local identification and storage mechanisms. 
</p>
<h4>Domain Semantics</h4>
<blockquote>
  "While HTTP is the standardized, stable foundation protocol honored by all parties and state management
  is the private concern of each individual party, <i>Domain Semantics</i> is the shared knowledge between
  willing participants on the network. It's the Domain Semantics upon which implementors and designers need to 
  focus."
</blockquote>
<p>
  leave HTTP alone, keep transient state a private concern of each party on the dist-net. the real place
  designers need to work is in the area of domain semantics; the shared understanding between consenting
  participants. and the way that works today is through the resource representations passed around the network.
</p>
<p>
  not the URIs, the representations.
</p>
<p>
  and the way domain semantics is shared is through a 
  <a href="../../hypermedia/hfactor.html" title="H Factor"><i>hypermedia type</i></a>; 
  one that supports link annotations (@rel), 
  state-transfers via "form"-like constructions (@name), and decorations of individual elements in the 
  response (@id and @class). it's the media type and its domain-specific details that provides the 
  semantic knowledge that is shared. hard coding clients to "just know" what to ask for, how to construct
  URIs, and when to ask for it is the wrong way to implement dist-net solutions. these processes result
  in 'empty' messages that have no semantic details shipped between parties that maintain lots of 'hard-coding'
  details promoting brittle-ness, instability, and inflexibility.
</p>
<p>
  it's the media type that provides the chance to customize messages between parties; to share understanding
  of what each data element and hyperlink 'means.' it's the media type that is specifically provided a 
  <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html" title="MIME Media Types">registry</a>
  where individuals who want to find shared understanding of a problem domain in order to 
  implement mutually agreed appropriate domain-level solutions. 
</p>
<blockquote>
  "In distributed networks, shared understanding is provided not through the standardized protocol and not
  through leaking private transient state bits, but through a well-designed and properly implemented
  hypermedia type. This is where the bulk of the effort should be spent."
</blockquote>
<h4>and so...</h4>
<p>
  over the last few years i've worked in a number of situations where the act of focusing on expressing the problem
  domain via media types has made it possible to build solutions that have the ability to evolve over time
  at very low expense (in both time and money). by making sure clients and servers get their shared understanding
  of the problem domain <i>through the messages passed between parties</i> and not through static, hard-coded
  rules, dist-net systems can successfully grow and evolve while still remaining stable and reliable for all
  participants. 
</p>
<p>
  in the end, building evolvable systems is not very complicated. it requires clear understanding of the
  transfer protocol, careful isolation of transient data, and dedicated work to properly express
  the problem domian via shared messages. it may not be a complex process, but it does take hard work.
</p>
<p>
  hard work that pays off not only in the long run, but every day you use the system.
