  </a>  
  rough day today. after a couple weeks of struggling, Milo, our 16 yr old tortoise-shell mixed-breed cat
  was unable to breathe properly and we had to say 'goodbye.' i won't go into the details, but it was long day starting
  with a morning emergency visit to the vet where he was placed in an oxygen enclosure and, after
  consultation w/ the doctor and w/ family, a late afternoon tearful farewell when we agreed to put him to sleep.
</p>
<h4>my teacher</h4>
<p>
    i learned a lot from Milo. the value of a good nap, a warm lap, and the ability to put your pride to one side
    while you begged at the table for any scraps you could get. i learned that there is nothing so important that
    it should get in the way of enjoying a playful "here-and-now" every so often. i learned that, no matter how
    soundly one is sleeping, if there is a knock at the door, you should get up and offer a friendly greeting
    of a leg rub and yodel. i learned that few things can beat the feel of a warm cuddle at the end of a long
    day; esp. when purring is involved. 
</p>
<p>
    Milo showed me <i>every day</i> how to enjoy life to the fullest. even if "the fullest" meant spending most of 
    the day resting on your favorite blanket or squeezed into your latest cardboard box lined w/ crinkly papers.
</p>
<h4>my supervisor</h4>

      <img width="150" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gmX5ploi6Gg/Uc4jdY7t0DI/AAAAAAAAOYE/5ceV_-56yJs/w660-h880-no/IMG_20130628_180921.jpg" align="right" class="inline" />
  </a>
    he also kept me focused. over the last year, i spent a good chunk of time working from home; mostly writing
    and doing research on upcoming projects. each day, as i sat down at my workstation for a round of work, 
    Milo would come to the base of my chair and start "talking" to me (he had quite a wide vocal range). 
</p>
<p>
    eventually, i learned to pull up an empty chair near the desk and he'd hop up, settle in, and keep an eye
    on my efforts. often, after about 30 minutes, he'd squeak, stretch, and signal that it was "break time."
    apparently, he understood about the dangers of sitting at a desk too long!
</p>
<p>
    not long after this pattern started, Milo was referred to as my 'supervisor' and the seat near my desk was known in the 
    house as 'the supervisor's chair.' the chair is still here next to me as i type this. 
</p>
<h4>my guide</h4>
<p>

    as i headed home from the vet's office today, i noticed that the sky was a clear, especially bright blue. 
    and it was dotted with a number of puffy altocummulus clouds. there was a warm breeze in the air, too.
    on days like this Milo liked to sit outside in the tall grass in our yard under a shade tree. he'd strain
    his neck to catch each breeze; carefully bobbing his head as he flared his nostrils sniffing the wind
    as he squinted. i always wondered what it was that he smelled; what gave him 
    such evident pleasure. whatever it was, he seemed to revel in each wafting breeze.
</p>
<p>
    in the last few days of his life Milo spent most of his days alone in our basement on a stack of blankets
    my son had arranged for him. he labored up and down the steps and, near the end, his breathing became shallow
    and strained. his nostrils flared again, but not to catch the scent of summer. now, he was struggling just
    to catch enough air to breathe. he'd stopped eating and had been losing weight, too. 
</p>
<p>
    still, he did his best to keep up appearances. no longer able to hop up on his chair, Milo rested at the
    foot of my desk. unable to even reach the couch, he settled along the edge of the storage chest we 
    used as a coffee table. when we coaxed him onto our lap, he tried his best to relax, but the pressure
    in his chest was so great that breathing caused his head to rock back and forth. he did his best
    for as long as we let him.
</p>
<h4>and so, farewell</h4>

     </a>
    even though today was a very bad day, i have many great memories of Milo. many great stories. many
    great lessons. i miss him already but will try to remember what i learned. live life to the fullest,
    enjoy the hear-and-now, appreciate the mystery in the warm summer breeze, and take a stretch every 30 minutes or so.
</p>
<p>
    as i finish this blog post, there's a summer rain hitting the roof. the sun is still shining off in the
    distance, too. and, sure enough, there's a double rainbow outside our front porch. i need to stop now
    and go enjoy that moment, too. 
</p>
<p>
    but before i do, i'll sign off with the same phrase i used everytime i left him in the 
    house as i took off on one of my many road trips. after a quick cuddle and a pat on the head, i'd head to 
    the door and call out over my shoulder:
</p>
